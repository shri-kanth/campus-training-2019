Exercise  : 
Signup and create GitHub account (If you do not have already). 
Create a repository on GitHub (With read-me and git-ignore files).  (By default you will have a 'master' branch created here)
Clone the repository onto your local system
Create a new branch called 'develop'
Write a program which reads an integer 'n' from stdin and print all the prime numbers less than that integer. (1 <= n <= 100) onto stdout.
Add and commit this file in you local repository 
Push the changes to GitHub remote repository (this should create a new branch called develop on your GitHub repository as well)
Create a pull request to merge the develop branch (which has the program file written in step 5) with master branch
Copy the pull request page URL and mail it to us.
Try to search on web for solution if you are stuck at any step. If you are still not clear, please send an email briefly explaining the issue you are facing.
